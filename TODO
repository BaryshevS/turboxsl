LIMITATIONS AND UNSUPPORTED FEATURES:
  - ONLY UTF-8!!! (other 8-bit codes work but string functions may return incorrect values)
  - XML namespaces not supported;
  - Entities and DTD instructions not supported
  - Comments and PI are discarded at parse time
  - No support for either strip-space or preserve-space

KNOWN BUGS:
  - leaks sometimes
  - format-number is rudimental, needs to be rewritten for full compliancy
  - possibly, incorrect == != operations on nodesets
  - not all standard functions are supported properly

WISHLIST:
  - implement callbacks in Perl module!
  - more multithreading  
  - implement control over threadpool
  - better string hashing?
  - implement better match strategies where linear search is used
  - optimize XPath evaluation
  - do not use EMPTY_NODE's where it is possible
